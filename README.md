## Background and Purpose
`fremor` is a model output rewriter (CMORizer) for FRE/FMS based models and output. It is specifically geared for standardizing 
NOAA-GFDL datasets for further quality control checks, assessments and data publishing pipelines in the context of CMIP7 
using the [`CMOR`](https://cmor.llnl.gov/) library.


### Relationship to `fre-cli`
`fremor` was originally the `fre.cmor` submodule of [`NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli`](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli) and so stands
on the shoulders of it's contributors, retaining it's general structure and lessons learned from it. Future re-integrations 
back into `fre-cli`, as a formal package dependency, are being assessed.

#### AI Disclaimer
AI was heavily used in the creation of this repository, primarily `github`'s `copilot` with `Claude` (`opus4.6`, `sonnet4.6`, 
and `haiku`), and `Gemini` and `Chat-GPT` models to a lesser extent, in agent mode. `Claude` and `Codex` agents have also 
contributed.




## Quickstart
For an overview of required inputs and sample commands, see the [CMOR Quickstart](docs/quickstart.rst).



## Installation / Access

### Requirements

- `python>=3.11`
- `click>=8.2`
- `cmor>=3.15.0`
- `netCDF4>=1.7`
- `numpy>=2`
- `pyyaml`

For development and testing, `pylint`, `pytest`, and `pytest-cov` are all highly recommended as helpful additions.



### via PPAN / modules (COMING SOON/TODO)
If you're trying to gain access to `fremor` functionality as quickly as possible:
```bash
# the current post-release in main
module load fremor/test

# a tagged version of fremor, post-releases will never be named modules
module load fremor/X.Y.Z
```


### via `conda` and/or `conda-forge`
If you have a path to a `fremor` environment you can activate it like so:
```bash
conda activate some/path/to/fremor_env
```

If you want your own `fremor` environment:
```bash
# the environment will be named fremor_en
conda create -n fremor_env conda-forge::fremor

# see fremor_env in the list --> activate it by name
conda env list
conda activate fremor_env
```

or, if you've already activated a `conda` environment
```bash
conda create -n empty_env
conda activate empty_env
conda install -c conda-forge fremor

# equivalent syntax
conda install conda-forge::fremor
```



### `pip install` into a virtual environment (`conda`/`venv`)

#### via `pip install [-e] .` with a checkout of the code
If you're trying to develop `fremor` capabilities, or edit the code to your liking in either a big or small way,
**this is for you**. This checks out the code, creates and activates an environment, installs into the environment,
and runs all unit-tests and `pylint` checks:
```bash
# omit --recursive if you don't want tables as submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fremor.git
cd fremor

# create an environment and install the local checkout
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate fremor
pip install -e . 

# Run tests
pytest fremor/tests/

# Run linter
pylint --rcfile pylintrc fremor/
```

#### via `pip install fremor` without a checkout of the code
not all of `fremor`'s dependencies are `pip` installable, so this method assumes you've grabbed the requirements, and made them
available to `fremor` in a common context via another method (`conda` is still easiest). Assuming this was done correctly and
all relevant python modules are installed to locations in `PYTHONPATH`, `pip install fremor` should install the package
from PyPI.


## Usage


### as a command line interface (CLI)
The CLI entry point is `fremor`, currently a suite of (currently) six routines for facilitating data preparation for
CMIP7. 
```bash
# The full list of subcommands
fremor init      # Initialize CMOR configuration resources: generate template user config, fetch tables
fremor find      # Find and print variables in MIP tables according to your variable lists or other input
fremor varlist   # Create a simple variable list of netCDF files in a directory
fremor config    # Generate a basic CMOR YAML configuration from a pp directory tree
fremor yaml      # Bulk routine for processing data based on a CMOR YAML config, calls fremor run many times
fremor run       # Lowest-level routine, no CMOR YAML needed, rewrites output files in a directory with CMOR
```

The CLI offers full logging and verbosity control independent of the command chosen:
```bash
# verbosity and logging
fremor -v  ...          # INFO level logging
fremor -vv ...          # DEBUG level logging
fremor -q  ...          # ERROR level only (quiet)
fremor -l mylog.txt ... # Log to file (appends)
```

If you've used the previous `fre cmor` command, there is a direct mapping of syntax:
```bash
# past fre-cli command
fre -vv -l logfile.txt cmor <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]

# fremor equivalent
fremor -vv -l logfile.txt <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]
```


### as a `python` module
Each CLI subcommand (`run`, `yaml`, etc.) maps to an API under under `fremor`, so the CLI functionality
is equivalently available via `import` in scripts as a proper `python` module




## CI/CD Workflows and QA


### WCRP Compliance Checking (under development)

[![wcrp_compliance_check](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fremor/actions/workflows/wcrp_compliance_check.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fremor/actions/workflows/wcrp_compliance_check.yml)

The `wcrp_compliance_check` workflow validates CMORized NetCDF outputs against WCRP project
specifications using [cc-plugin-wcrp](https://github.com/ESGF/cc-plugin-wcrp), a plugin for
the [IOOS compliance-checker](https://github.com/ioos/compliance-checker). This pipeline:

- Runs automatically on pull requests and via manual dispatch
- Executes unit tests to generate CMORized output files
- Gathers and categorizes outputs by CMIP version (CMIP6, CMIP7)
- Validates outputs using the `wcrp_cmip6` compliance checker
- Uploads compliance reports as workflow artifacts (retained for 30 days)

To view compliance results from a workflow/CI run:
1. Navigate to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select the `wcrp_compliance_check` workflow run
3. Download the `wcrp-compliance-reports` artifact





## Versioning and tags
`fremor` uses a post-release scheme to identify development beyond the latest tagged version. To avoid confusion 
with `fre-workflows` and `fre-cli`, which often demand that the version tags match, `fremor`'s version format is 
`X.Y.Z[.post]`.
