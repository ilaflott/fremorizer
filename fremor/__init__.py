"""
``fremor``: CMORization for FRE output
==========================================

This module provides routines which rewrite post-processed FRE/FMS model output in a community-driven, standardized way.
This module relies heavily on PCMDI's CMOR module and it's ``python`` API. It is the core implementation for
``fremor run`` operations- mixing and matching GFDL's and FRE's conventions to CMOR's expectations, so that
participation in model-intercomparison projects may be eased. For more usage details, see the project README.md, the
FRE documentation at https://noaa-gfdl.readthedocs.io/projects/fre-cli/en/latest/, PCMDI's CMOR module documentation at 
https://cmor.llnl.gov/, and of course ``fremor``'s documentation at https://fremor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. 

.. note:: this text is set by ``fremor/__init__.py``'s docstring. Importing ``fremor`` sets the version attribute, and sets 
          up a ``fre_logger``
